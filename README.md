## Project Description
This project was created in C++. This project is a word game featuring a graphical interface developed using the C++ programming language and the Qt framework. The primary goal of the project is to enhance users' vocabulary and provide an enjoyable learning experience. The target audience includes students, language learners, and word game enthusiasts.

The project aims to comprehensively implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Core classes will include Game (game management), Player (player information), and WordManager (word processing). Through composition, the Game class will contain Player and WordManager objects. Using inheritance, derived subclasses will be created from a base class for different game modes (classic, timed). The polymorphism feature will enable different behaviors through the same interface across various game modes, while exception handling will manage situations such as invalid word entries and file reading errors.

The graphical user interface will consist of buttons, a timer display, a scoreboard, and colorful word tiles, offering a user-friendly and intuitive experience. The technical infrastructure will include word database management, time management, and file I/O operations. Thanks to the project's extensible design, features such as new game modes and multi-language support can be added in the future.
